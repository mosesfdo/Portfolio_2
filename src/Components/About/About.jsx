          <p>
            Moses is a student of Computer Science and AI/ML driven by a deep
            curiosity that fuels his passion for problem-solving and UI design.
            He thrives on prototyping new interfaces and experimenting with
            emerging tools, blending a structured approach with a spirit of
            discovery.

          <p>
            His technical toolkit includes Python, HTML, and CSS, reflecting a
            solid foundation in programming and web technologies. Outside
            academics, Moses balances coding side projects with working out and
            immersing himself in anime culture. At heart, he is a coder refining
            his craft, a fitness enthusiast pushing his limits, and an anime fan
            savoring stories. Always learning â€” always driven by the endless
            possibilities of technology and design.
